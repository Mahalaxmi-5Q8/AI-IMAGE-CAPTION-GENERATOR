# AI-IMAGE-CAPTION-GENERATOR

# 🖼️ Image Caption Generator

An AI-powered web application that generates natural language descriptions for images using transformer-based deep learning models.

## 📌 Overview
This project leverages Hugging Face Transformers, including BLIP or Vision Transformer (ViT) with GPT-2, to generate captions for images. It uses a Gradio-based UI for seamless user interaction, and supports model inference using PyTorch or TensorFlow.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Hugging Face Transformers** – Pretrained models like BLIP, ViT, and GPT-2
- **Gradio** – Web interface for user interaction
- **PyTorch / TensorFlow** – Deep learning frameworks for model inference
- **dotenv** – For secure environment configuration
